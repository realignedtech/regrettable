The world's first AI-powered platform for generating applications you'll regret. Inspired by the chaos of vibe coding, manifested into pure, unfiltered technical debt.

## Features

- **Lightning Fast*** - *On a quantum computer from the future
- **AI Powered** - Trained exclusively on Stack Overflow questions (not answers)
- **Secure-ish** - We store passwords in a spreadsheet (it's password protected though)
- **Global Scale** - Your app can crash in 150+ countries simultaneously

## Requirements

- Go 1.22+ (or any version, we don't check)
- A complete disregard for best practices
- At least 3 mass regret events under your belt
- Coffee (47+ liters recommended)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo (you'll regret this)
git clone https://github.com/realignedtech/regrettable.git

# Enter the danger zone
cd regrettable

# Run it (no tests because we live dangerously)
go run main.go

# Deploy to production on a Friday at 5pm (mandatory)
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `PORT` | The port to serve chaos on | `8080` |

That's it. We believe in simplicity (and avoiding configuration).

3. Don't write tests
4. Submit a PR on Friday at 4:59 PM
5. Mark it as "URGENT"

## Deployment

Simply don't. Just don't.

## Support

Ask ChatGPT for emotional support. Submit Issues if you really must


## License

## Disclaimer

This project is satire. If you actually use this to build production software, you deserve what happens next.
